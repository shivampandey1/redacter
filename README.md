## Overview of the Codebase
This code automatically documents Python functions by converting the code to an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), using GPT-3.5 to generate explanations, and then injecting these explanations back into the original code, allowing you to hide the functions themselves (for PII and general confidentiality).

### Parsing Functions with AST
- `get_function_info(node)`: This function captures essential details about a function node in the AST. It returns a dictionary containing the function's name, parameters, and body.
- `FunctionVisitor`: An AST node visitor class that traverses the code to identify all function definitions and collect their information.
- `function_parser(code)`: This function uses AST to parse the Python code and employs `FunctionVisitor` to gather data about all the functions in the code.

### GPT-3.5 Interaction
- `ask_gpt_3_5(...)`: This function communicates with the GPT-3.5 API to generate text based on a prompt. It includes a retry mechanism in case of errors.
- `generate_function_explanations(...)`: This function constructs the prompts for GPT-3.5 based on the parsed functions and collects the generated explanations.

### Replacing Function Bodies
- `FunctionBodyReplacer`: A class that inherits from `ast.NodeTransformer`. It's tasked with replacing the original function bodies with the explanations generated by GPT-3.5.
- `replace_function_bodies_with_explanations(...)`: This function takes the original code and the explanations, replaces the function bodies with the explanations, and returns the new code.

### Main Execution
1. The `__main__` block starts with sample Python code containing two functions (`foo` and `bar`) for demonstration.
2. `function_parser()` is called to analyze these functions.
3. `generate_function_explanations()` fetches explanations for each function from GPT-3.5.
4. `replace_function_bodies_with_explanations()` replaces the original function bodies with these explanations.
5. The updated code is then printed out.
